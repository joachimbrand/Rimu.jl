# Module `Hamiltonians`

This module contains definitions of Hamiltonians, in particular specific
physical models of interest. These are organised by means of an interface
around the abstract type [`AbstractHamiltonian`](@ref), in the spirit of the
`AbstractArray` interface as discussed in the [Julia Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/interfaces/).

The Hamiltonians can be used for projector quantum Monte Carlo with [`ProjectorMonteCarloProblem`](@ref) or for exact diagonalization with [`ExactDiagonalizationProblem`](@ref), see [Exact Diagonalization](@ref).

## Model Hamiltonians

Here is a list of fully implemented model Hamiltonians. There are several variants
of the Hubbard model in real and momentum space, as well as some other models.

### Real space Hubbard models
```@docs

```

### Momentum space Hubbard models

```

### Harmonic oscillator models
```@docs

HOCartesianEnergyConservedPerDim
HOCartesianCentralImpurity
```

### Other

## Hamiltonian wrappers
The following Hamiltonians are constructed from an existing
Hamiltonian instance and change its behaviour:

ParitySymmetry
TimeReversalSymmetry
Stoquastic
```

## Observables
Observables are [`AbstractHamiltonian`](@ref)s that represent a physical
observable. Their ground state expectation values can be sampled by passing
them into [`AllOverlaps`](@ref).

## Hamiltonians interface

Behind the implementation of a particular model is a more abstract interface for defining
Hamiltonians. If you want to define a new model you should make use of this interface. The
most general form of a model Hamiltonian should subtype to `AbstractHamiltonian` and
implement the relevant methods.

```@docs
AbstractHamiltonian
offdiagonals
diagonal_element
starting_address
```

The following functions may be implemented instead of [`offdiagonals`](@ref).

```@docs
num_offdiagonals
get_offdiagonal
```

The following functions come with default implementations, but may be customized.

```@docs
random_offdiagonal
Hamiltonians.LOStructure
dimension
has_adjoint
allowed_address_type
```

This interface relies on unexported functionality, including
```@docs
Hamiltonians.adjoint
Hamiltonians.dot
Hamiltonians.AbstractOffdiagonals
Hamiltonians.Offdiagonals
Hamiltonians.check_address_type
Hamiltonians.number_conserving_dimension
Hamiltonians.number_conserving_bose_dimension
Hamiltonians.number_conserving_fermi_dimension
```

## Geometry

Lattices in higher dimensions are defined here for [`HubbardRealSpace`](@ref) and [`G2RealSpace`](@ref).

```@docs

Hamiltonians.Directions
Hamiltonians.Displacements
Hamiltonians.neighbor_site

```

## Harmonic Oscillator
Useful utilities for harmonic oscillator in Cartesian basis, see [`HOCartesianContactInteractions`](@ref)
and [`HOCartesianEnergyConservedPerDim`](@ref).
