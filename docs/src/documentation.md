# Documentation generation

We are using [`Documenter.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) to generate the
documentation web site based on markdown files stored in `docs/src`. Please help keeping the
documentation up-to-date by editing the markdown files! For instructions on how to write
appropriate documentation please refer to the relevant chapter in the Julia
[documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/documentation/) and the
`Documenter.jl` [documentation](https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/latest/).

## Generating the documentation web site

The documentation pages can be generated by running the build script by typing

```
Rimu$ julia --project=docs docs/make.jl
```

on the shell prompt from the `Rimu/` folder. A complete image of the static documentation
web site will be generated in the folder `docs/build/`. It can be viewed locally by pointing
a web browser to file `docs/build/index.html`, or by deploying it to the GitHub pages web
server.

## Automatic documentation generation and deployment

Our documentation is hosted on GitHub pages. The documentation web site can be built and
deployed automatically with GitHub Actions. This needs to be set up with an appropriate
script in the file `.github/workflows/docs.yml`, where triggers for this to happen can be
defined. In the current set up, a new documentation web site is generated and deployed
whenever someone pushes to the develop branch on the GitHub server. The updated
documentation can then be accessed [here](https://joachimbrand.github.io/Rimu.jl/dev/).

Previews for pull-requests can be accessed by replacing 101 in the following link with the PR number: [https://joachimbrand.github.io/Rimu.jl/previews/PR101/](https://joachimbrand.github.io/Rimu.jl/previews/PR101/)

### Example scripts

Examples should be added to the `scripts` folder, in the form of `.jl` files suitable for 
parsing by [`Literate`](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl). The process of generating 
documentation is automated in the `docs/make.jl` file and assumes that the following line is 
at (or near) the top of the script:
```
# # Example N: Title
```
where the number `N` and `Title` will be extracted automatically.

Tests for the results and output of specific scripts should be added to `test/example.jl`. 

Examples that require MPI functionality should have `mpi` in the filename, and tests for these 
should instead be added to `test/mpi_runtests.jl`.
