Each replica has its own state and FCIQMC is effectively performed independently on each one.  For calculating observables, we use AllOverlaps for the ReplicaStrategy.

This is done with localpart. In general, even when not using MPI, it is best practice to use localpart when explicit iteration is required.\n\nUse with KrylovKit\n\nPDVec is compatible with eigsolve from KrylovKit.jl. When used, the diagonalisation is performed in a threaded and distributed manner. Using multiple MPI ranks with this method does not distribute the memory load effectively, but does result in significant speedups.\n\nExample\n\njulia> using KrylovKit\n\njulia> add = BoseFS((0,0,5,0,0));\n\njulia> op = HubbardMom1D(add; u=6.0);\n\njulia> pv = PDVec(add => 1.0);\n\njulia> results = eigsolve(op, pv, 4, :SR);\n\njulia> results[1][1:4]\n4-element Vector{Float64}:\n -3.4311156892322234\n  1.1821748602612363\n  3.7377753753082823\n  6.996390417443125\n\nParallel functionality\n\nThe following functions are threaded and MPI-compatible:\n\nFrom Base: mapreduce and derivatives (sum, prod, reduce...), all, any,map!
