Each replica has its own state and FCIQMC is effectively performed independently on each one.  For calculating observables, we use AllOverlaps for the ReplicaStrategy.

Which dictionary a key-value pair is mapped to is determined by the hash of the key. The purpose of this segmentation is to allow parallel processing - functions such as mapreduce, add! or dot (full list below) process each subdictionary on a separate thread.\n\nExample\n\njulia> add = FermiFS2C((1,1,0,0), (0,0,1,1));\n\njulia> op = HubbardMom1D(add; t=4/π^2, u=4);\n\njulia> pv = PDVec(add => 1.0)\n1-element PDVec: style = IsDeterministic{Float64}()\n  fs\"|↑↑↓↓⟩\" => 1.0\n\njulia> pv = op * pv\n7-element PDVec: style = IsDeterministic{Float64}()\n  fs\"|↑↓↑↓⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|↑↑↓↓⟩\" => 4.0\n  fs\"|↓↑↓↑⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|↓↑↑↓⟩\" => -1.0\n  fs\"|⇅⋅⋅⇅⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|↑↓↓↑⟩\" => -1.0\n  fs\"|⋅⇅⇅⋅⟩\" => 1.0\n\njulia> map!(x -> -x, values(pv)); pv\n7-element PDVec: style = IsDeterministic{Float64}()\n  fs\"|↑↓↑↓⟩\" => -1.0\n  fs\"|↑↑↓↓⟩\" => -4.0\n  fs\"|↓↑↓↑⟩\" => -1.0\n  fs\"|↓↑↑↓⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|⇅⋅⋅⇅⟩\" => -1.0\n  fs\"|↑↓↓↑⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|⋅⇅⇅⋅⟩\" => -1.0\n\njulia> dest = similar(pv)\n0-element PDVec: style = IsDeterministic{Float64}()\n\njulia> map!(x -> x + 2, dest, values(pv))\n7-element PDVec: style = IsDeterministic{Float64}()\n  fs\"|↑↓↑↓⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|↑↑↓↓⟩\" => -2.0\n  fs\"|↓↑↓↑⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|↓↑↑↓⟩\" => 3.0\n  fs\"|⇅⋅⋅⇅⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|↑↓↓↑⟩\" => 3.0\n  fs\"|⋅⇅⇅⋅⟩\" => 1.0\n\njulia> sum(values(pv))\n-6.0\n\njulia> dot(dest, pv)\n10.0\n\njulia> dot(dest, op, pv)\n44.0\n\nMPI\n\nWhen MPI is active, all parallel reductions are automatically reduced across MPI ranks with a call to MPI.Allreduce.\n\nIn a distributed setting, PDVec does not support iteration without first making it explicit the iteration is only to be performed on the local segments of the vector. This is done with localpart. In general, even when not using MPI, it is best practice to use localpart when explicit iteration is required.\n\nUse with KrylovKit\n\nPDVec is compatible with eigsolve from KrylovKit.jl. When used, the diagonalisation is performed in a threaded and distributed manner. Using multiple MPI ranks with this method does not distribute the memory load effectively, but does result in significant speedups.\n\nExample\n\njulia> using KrylovKit\n\njulia> add = BoseFS((0,0,5,0,0));\n\njulia> op = HubbardMom1D(add; u=6.0);\n\njulia> pv = PDVec(add => 1.0);\n\njulia> results = eigsolve(op, pv, 4, :SR);\n\njulia> results[1][1:4]\n4-element Vector{Float64}:\n -3.4311156892322234\n  1.1821748602612363\n  3.7377753753082823\n  6.996390417443125\n\nParallel functionality\n\nThe following functions are threaded MPI-compatible:\n\nFrom Base: mapreduce and derivatives (sum, prod, reduce...), all, any,map!
